2. Load AclView Plugin on Config/bootstrap.php
3. Access http://[YOUR-PROJECT-URL]/permissoes

***
### Twitter Bootstrap
ACL View is Bootstrap-ready! If you are using another Layout Scheme, you have to copy View/Permissoes/index.ctp to [APP]/Views/Plugin/acl_view/Permissoes/

### ACL Component
ACL View only works if CakePHP's AclComponent is working.

### Group-Based Only
ACL View was tested only using Group-Based Acl, as shown [here](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/tutorials-and-examples/simple-acl-controlled-application/simple-acl-controlled-application.html#group-only-acl).
